Hello and welcome! My research focuses on how we (humans) and machines see and know things. In my PhD, I have investigated how people and artificial networks differentiate objects from their backgrounds in natural scenes and how feedback connections in human brains assist with this process. I'm currently wrapping up my PhD and looking for new opportunities to continue in the same line of research. 

When I'm not doing research, I'm dancing, bouldering (which is basically dancing on walls), or making cocktails. I enjoy talking to people from diverse backgrounds and continually discovering surprising things in my environment.
